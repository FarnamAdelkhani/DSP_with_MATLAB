# DSP with MATLAB - FIR Filters Part 2 of 2

This lab builds on the theoretical ideas conveyed in the first part of this investigation into FIR filtering, be sure to complete the work in part one first, or please have an understanding of the method used to apply a Kaiser filter in the previous section. 

The goal is to investigate Spline, frequency sampled, and optimum FIR filters; then to compare their properties with those observed in the previous section. 

The filters will then be applied to separate DTMF tones.
